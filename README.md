# AdvancedSavingsCalculator
This program prompts the user to enter their monthly income, monthly expenses, savings goal, number of years they want to save for and the annual interest rate. It then uses this information to validate the inputs and calculate the monthly, daily, and annual savings needed, the total savings needed, and the interest earned to reach the goal.
